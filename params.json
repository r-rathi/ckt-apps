{"name":"Ckt-apps","tagline":"Circuit design and analysis utilities","body":"Ckt-apps: Circuit Design and Analysis Applications\r\n==================================================\r\n\r\n**Ckt-apps** is a suite of circuit design and anaysis (EDA) applications as well as the package (library) itself on which the applications are based.\r\n\r\nApplications\r\n------------\r\nThe end-user applications are in the *bin* directory. Currently, following applications are provided:\r\n- `bin/report_net.py` - Report nets in the design with summary of wire, driver, and load caps and fanouts.\r\n\r\nThe cktapps package\r\n-------------------\r\nThe architecture of `cktapps` is very modular and extensible. The main componets are:\r\n- `core` : At the _core_ of ckt-apps is a circuit netlist database that represents the basic circuit elements and their connectivity. The database supports hierarchical designs, and can be queried as well as modified through the core API interface.\r\n- `formats` : Contains netlist format specific modules that provide reading and writing in addition to any other format specific functionality. Following formats are currently supported:\r\n  * `spice`\r\n- `apps` : Contains a library of design and analysis utilities in the form of importable functions, classes, and modules. The end-user scripts in the *bin* directory are essentially wrappers that provide a command-line interface and internally use one or more components from the the *apps* package to provide the end-user functionality.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nClone the repository:\r\n\r\n    $git clone https://github.com/r-rathi/ckt-apps\r\n\r\nOr, download the tarball:\r\n\r\n    $curl -L -o ckt-apps.tar.gz https://api.github.com/repos/r-rathi/ckt-apps/tarball\r\n\r\nOr, go to https://github.com/r-rathi/ckt-apps and click on the ZIP button.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nThe applications should be called directly from the package directory:\r\n\r\n    $ /path/to/ckt-apps/bin/report_net.py -h\r\n\r\nOr, if python is not in you path, then:\r\n\r\n    $ /path/to/python /path/to/ckt-apps/bin/report_net.py -h\r\n\r\nExample\r\n-------\r\n`bin/report_net.py` reports the wire, driver, and load capacitances and the driver fanout for all the nets in a specified cell. If no cell is given, then the (first) top-cell is used. Using the lib and netlist from `ckt-apps/test_data`:\r\n\r\n    $ bin/report_net.py --lib test_data/lib.sp test_data/test1.sp\r\n\r\n    ****************************************\r\n    Report : net\r\n            -capacitance=True\r\n            -fanout=True\r\n            -sortby=fanout, reversesort=True\r\n    Cell   : buf\r\n    Date   : 02:04AM April 08, 2013\r\n    ****************************************\r\n    \r\n    Lib     : test_data/lib.sp\r\n    Netlist : test_data/test1.sp\r\n    \r\n    Fields:\r\n    - net     : net name\r\n    - cwire   : wire capacitance (fF)\r\n    - cload   : load (gate connected transistors) capacitance (fF)\r\n    - cdriver : driver (src/drain connected transistors) capacitance (fF)\r\n    - fanout  : fanout of the driver = cout/cin = (cwire + cload)/cdriver\r\n    \r\n    --------------------------------------------\r\n      net     cwire   cload   cdriver   fanout  \r\n    --------------------------------------------\r\n      n2        8.0     0.4       0.2     42.0  \r\n      b2/n2     5.0     0.2       0.2     26.0  \r\n      b3/n2     9.0     0.4       0.4     23.5  \r\n      vss      21.0     0.0       0.9     23.3  \r\n      b1/n2     4.0     0.4       0.2     22.0  \r\n      vdd      15.0     0.0       0.9     16.7  \r\n      y         6.0     0.0       0.4     15.0  \r\n      n1        3.0     0.2       0.4      8.0  \r\n      a         1.0     0.2       0.0      0.0  \r\n    --------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Rohit Rathi &lt;rrathi.appdev@gmail.com&gt;\r\n\r\nCkt-apps is provided under the MIT License.
